# Python Photo Enhancer 

I created this project to help me with editing heightmaps for a game I am creating with Unreal Engine 5. I got the heightmaps using Lidar imagery. The goal was to make the images have higher contrast and smoother edges so when the heightmaps are used in UE5 the edges arent too sharp and triangular.
